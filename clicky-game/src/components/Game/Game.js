import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./Game.css";

// saw structure of other clicky games have this component will research if I need 
//it or if I can just pull the components together in the app.js file

//saw some structure this component in a way to inmport all other components to this game.js then this game.js is exported to app.js for rendering. This may seem simple enough just remember to follow this structure from top to bottom:
    // App.js => imports Game.js which imports: ClickItem.js, Nav.js, NavMessage.js, Footer.js
